        "- Python is an interpreted language which means python programs are executed in an line by line compilation and its slower compared to other languages who follow compilation of the program for an output but debugging is comparatively easier in python since it instantaneously detects an error and makes it easier for the debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "- Python pre defined keywords refer to the primitive methods in python which are already inbuilt in the python code with its features.<br>\n",

        "a bank needs user to create an password with only integer data type but the user uses words as this will throw an error and will maintain the banks password regulations.\n",
        "<br> some languages using this method is C,C++,JAVA\n",
